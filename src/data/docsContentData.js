                "What is the difference between practicing telemedicine and running a virtual clinic?",
              answer:
                "Telemedicine typically refers to providing remote consultations on an individual or ad-hoc basis—using tools like video calls or phone consultations. In contrast, a virtual clinic is a fully integrated, branded digital practice. It comes with structured scheduling, automated workflows, ongoing client relationship management, and integrated billing systems. Essentially, while telemedicine is a mode of delivering care, a virtual clinic is a complete business model designed to scale and enhance your remote practice.",

      mainDescription: `Assembly Bill (AB) 1399 (Friedman, Chapter 475, Statutes of 2023) took effect 
    on January 1, 2024. This legislation sets out clear requirements for establishing a 
    valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR) before prescribing, dispensing, 
    or administering any treatment for animal care. (Business and Professions Code (BPC), 
    § 4826.6.) AB 1399 also clarifies how veterinary telehealth may be provided under 
    California law. (BPC, §§ 4825.1, 4826.6, 4829.5, and 4853.)
    
    Below are frequently asked questions (FAQs) the Veterinary Medical Board (Board) has 
    compiled in response to public inquiries about the new law. We’ve included notes on 
    how Vetcation’s features help veterinary professionals comply with each requirement 
    through our built-in workflows and technology tools. In the event of any differences 
    between these FAQs and the statute itself, the statute is controlling, and the Board 
    will enforce it accordingly. Veterinary professionals should review the official 
    statutes in detail to ensure full compliance.`,

                "A VCPR exists when a veterinarian takes responsibility for making medical judgments regarding an animal patient, and the client agrees to follow the vet’s instructions.

However, you must still adhere to all Veterinary Medical Board regulations for recordkeeping and potential inspections. If you occasionally perform in-person services or store controlled substances in-state, you might need to register a veterinary premise license. Check Board regulations (BPC, §§ 4853–4854) to confirm whether a premise permit is required for your specific practice model.",
              example:
                "If you’re a fully remote vet living in Nevada but licensed in California, you can conduct telehealth consults for pets located in California without a California brick-and-mortar. But if you decide to offer limited in-person services in California (vaccination clinics, etc.), you’d likely need a registered premise.",

                "Vetcation’s software is designed so you can fully operate virtually without a physical clinic, as long as your license is in good standing and you meet AB 1399’s telehealth requirements. Always check with the Board if you expand into any in-person services that might trigger premise permit obligations.",
